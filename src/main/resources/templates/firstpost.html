<div>Computer software, or simply software, is a part of a computer system that consists of data or computer
    instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. In computer science and software
    engineering, computer software is defined as the information processed by computer systems, programs, and data.
    Computer software includes computer programs, libraries, and related non-executable data, such as online
    documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other, and neither can be realistically
    used on its own.
